# How React Works With the Browser

There is no new code introduced in this module. The app uses the todo items app that can be found in the folder in this repo:

`/m2-introduction-to-react/clips-all`.

For convenience, the code is also here in `m4-how-react-works-with-the-browser/clip-02` (same as clips-all folder).
